# ConnectedCell

Given a matrix of n x m cells find and print the largest region. Each cell is connected to its neighboring cell, which includes ones to the left, right, top, bottom and the diagnols. Any cell marked as 1 is said to be filled and one or more filled cells that are connected form a region.

Example:

```
1 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1
```

The largest region contains 5 connected cells which starts in the upper corner of (0, 0).
